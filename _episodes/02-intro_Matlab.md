## What does Matlab/Octave need to know about the BIDS structure in order to run EEGLAB?

#### **EEGLAB is a set of Matlab functions (... which are text files).**

Before we get started analyzing EEG data in EEGLAB lets take a look at how the functions operate in the Matlab environment. Matlab is and interpreted language. This means that it will read some text, interpret it in a very specific way and then perform the operations that are defined by the text.

For our purposes we can think of Matlab doing two very important things:
1. it stores information in memory as different kinds of variables
2. it can perform operations (or functions) on those variable

Lets open the Matlab Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and take a look at these capabilities.

> ## Anatomy of the Matlab Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
> The Matlab IDE is made up of several sections in the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Each of these are important to understand as we move towards interacting with EEG data via EEGLAB.
> 1. Command Window: This is where we interact with Matlab using the Command Line Interface (CLI) creating variable and performaing operations on them.
> 2. Current FOlder: This is the directory that Matlab if pointing to. This is the part of the file system that Matlab sees an is its starting point for relative paths.
> 3. Workspace: this is a summary of the variables that are accessible to the Command Window
> 4. Command History: This is the interactive list of operations that have been called from the Command Window.
> 5. Editor: This is a text editor with added features for modifying Matlable interpreted text files (*.m files).

#### **Creating variables in the Matlab CLI**
Making new variables (or modifying existing variables) is accomplished using the "=" character.

We can create a new variable named "x" and make it equal to a series of numbers:
~~~
>> x=[1,2,3,4,5];
~~~
{: .source}

> ## There are several ways to store information in the workspace
>There are several types of variables in Matlab, such as the numeric array above, but there are also strings, cell arrays and structures. EEGLAB stores its information in a structure named "EEG". That is where we will find all of the EEG properties that EEGLAB has at its disposal later in this lesson.
{: .callout}

#### **Performing operations on variables in the Matlab CLI**

We can also perform operations on the variable and have the result saved to a new varialbe "y":
~~~
>> y=mean(x);
~~~
{: .source}
